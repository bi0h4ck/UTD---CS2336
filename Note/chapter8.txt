CHAPTER 8: MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAY

* An element in a two-dimensional array is accessed through a row and column index.
* The syntax for declaring a two-dimensional array is:
  elementType[][] arrayRefVar;

* A two-dimensional array is actually an array in which each element is a one-dimensional array.
* Each row in a two-dimensional array is itself an array. Thus, the rows can have different lengths. An array of this kind is known as a ragged array.

int[][] triangleArray = new int[5][]; 
triangleArray[0] = new int[5]; 
triangleArray[1] = new int[4]; 
triangleArray[2] = new int[3]; 
triangleArray[3] = new int[2]; 
triangleArray[4] = new int[1];
