CHAPTER 5: LOOPS

5.1 Intro
	* A loop can be used to tell a program to execute statements repeatedly
	* while loops
	* do-while loops
	* for loops

5.2 The While loop
	* executes statements repeatedly while the condition is true
	* Counter-controlled loop -> know exactly how many times the loop body needs to be executed

	5.2.5 Input and output redirections
		java SentinelValue < input.txt
		=> this command is called input redirection. The program takes the input from the file input.txt rather than having the user type the data from the keyboard

		java ClassName > output.txt
		* output redirection -> sends the output to a file rather than displaying it on the console

5.3 The do-while loop
	* executes the loop body first and then checks the loop continuation condition

5.4 The for loop
	* has a concise syntax for writing loops

5.7 Minimizing numeric errors
	* using floating-point numbers in the loop continuation condition may cause numeric errors

5.8 Keywords break and continue
	* provide additional controls in a loop
	* break -> break out of a loop -> used in switch statement or in a loop
	* continue -> end the current iteration and program control goes to the end of the loop body
